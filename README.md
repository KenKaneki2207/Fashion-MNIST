# Fashion_MNIST_classification_model

**Image Classification** : Make the model understand the difference between different types of clothes in Fashion MNIST dataset.

**Fashion-MNIST :** This dataset contains 60000 images for traning the model and 10000 images for testing the dataset.
The dataset is classified into 10 different types of clothing categories.

**Steps to create an regression model :**

1. Import the required libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data Visualisaation
4. Data Preprocessing(Normalization etc.)
5. Creating the model
6. Evaluating with confusionn matrix.
7. Experimenting with hyperparameters to increase the accuracy
